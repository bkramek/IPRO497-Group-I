# Faculty Feedback #

## Grading Philosophy ##
- Team grade - You start with an A and we will give you feedback if your team performance is falling below the A pace (e.g., your A is at risk).
- Individual grade - your attendance (see syllabus) and contributions to the team are key factors in your grade.  You start with an A and we will give you feedback if your performance is falling below the A pace (e.g., your A is at risk).  Also look at Github Insights in your repository to see how active you are and how active others are.

## Week 2 - Jan 18 ##

## Week 3 - Jan 25 ##

## Week 4 - Feb 1 ##
- Good product design document
- Your backlog needs to have at least two weeks worth of stories so you know what comes next

## Week 5 - Feb 8 ##
 - You are mobbing too much and it slows you down. Each person should have a story that they own and are working on each week.
 - When faculty visits (facilitator assigned for the week opens the Kanban board and filters on each person). Each team member takes one minute to talk about the work
item they finished, and what work item they are working on. Their should be very little "we" and mostly "I" in explaining completed stories
## Week 6 - Feb 15 ##
- Christopher had mic problem (happens to us all...)
- Only three stories are "done" so far.  Each week stories should be moving into the "done" column.
- Be sure the board is current when the faculty member joins your group
- Benjamin did some nice wireframe work but none of it was reflected in work items/user stories. Story first, then work

## Week 7 - Feb 22 ##
- Each work item / user story should have detailed description and acceptance criteria/checklist so you know what "done" looks like. Lots of team members
are missing acceptance criteria
- Good board hygiene this week ie: finished work in done column, etc. 

## Week 8 - Mar 1 ##
