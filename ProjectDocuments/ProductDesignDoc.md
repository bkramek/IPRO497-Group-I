## Problem Statements ##

Students want to quickly and reliably reserve spaces on campus that can accomodate their individual study needs, whether they study alone or with a group.

Students want to be able to find out how busy an area of campus is at a particular time, so that they can select an area of campus that meets their preferences for frequency of use.
