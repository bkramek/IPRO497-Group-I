The goal is to create reserved study space to where college students are free from distraction. We will contain productivity within these spaces to have complete organization, plans for study sessions, and an inspiring environment.

College students can reserve pre-approved spaces on campus, allowing them to find quiet and non-distracting spaces to study without wasting time finding them.
